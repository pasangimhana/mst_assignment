# MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) Code

This code implements algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees in graphs.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have `g++` (GNU C++ compiler) installed on your system.

### Building and Running

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MST.git
    cd MST
    ```

2. **Compile the Code:**

   Use the provided Makefile to compile the code. Simply run:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

   This will generate the executable file named `MST`.

3. **Run the Code:**

   Execute the generated executable:

    ```bash
    ./MST
    ```

## File Structure

- `graphFactory/`: Contains files related to graph representation and factories.
- `helpers/`: Contains helper functions.
- `main.cpp`: Main program file.

## Cleaning Up

To remove the generated executable and any intermediate files, you can run:

```bash
make clean
```
